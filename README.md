# LibraryManagment

This is a Java library managment application that help users borrow books from the library and the library to add, delete, etc.
Users have to create an account and login to the application, admins can login to admin setup and create admin accounts.
Currently i work at a bookstore chain and i like to read books so i came up with this project idea.
